Affect is a streamlined and natural [concurrency model] for OCaml 5.
It just provides parallel asynchronous function calls with structured
cooperative concurrency and cancellation.

## Sample code

A few basic sample programs can be found in the [test](test/)
directory.

* [`ping.ml`](test/ping.ml), client and server using `Funix` to 
  do useless networking on your machine.
* [`mouse.ml`](test/mouse.ml), proof of concept interfacing 
  with the SDL event loop.
* [`happy_eyeballs.ml`](test/happy_eyeballs.ml), an implementation
  of a happy eyeballs 

You can run them with `b0 -- ping` or `b0 -- mouse`.
